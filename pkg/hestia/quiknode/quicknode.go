	If referers is set, you will need to pass it as a header with each request you make to the customer's endpoint.
	Additionally, you should definitely store all of these pieces of information.

	We will use the access-url to show the customer how they can access the service
	(for example, if itâ€™s an explorer, graph instance, some kind of index, GraphQL API or, REST API).
	If you are providing a JSON-RPC method, then simply return access-url as null. We will use the dashboard-url
	to log the customer into your service with SSO. We have a guide on SSO [here]().

	If responding with error, please be sure to use a non-200 HTTP status code.
