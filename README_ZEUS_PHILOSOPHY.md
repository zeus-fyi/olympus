## How Things are Done on Olympus

This is a technology first, and forward-thinking company, where the best ideas win, and the execution of them and their
success is driven from all levels in cohesion. This is a place that rewards and cherishes individual talent, authenticity,
and creativity and unorthodox thinking first, all else a distant second. We use computers, technology and ingenuity to 
solve problems, not by adding more people. This is a place where we do more with a handful of engineers than other 
companies have entire organizations working on, and a home to fellow technologists and iconoclasts, where
the merit of your contributions determine the vast majority of your success, not the skill of your politicking. 

It doesn't matter if you're an intern or a sr. staff engineer, or been "here" for a while. All high effort proposals
are considered seriously, every voice is heard. If a better proposal "deprecates" your "project", that's something to
celebrate, because now we can solve bigger problems, and it won't count against you anyway. If you need to "tone-police"
people, or can't accept technical criticism on your work (which is how you grow by the way), or if you aren't open to 
ideas from across "levels", outside your "department", or "function", then you are especially not welcome here. If a better
design, like a 10x improvement is suggested, and well documented and evidence supported we will do that, end of discussion.

### How We Operate

We do complex things here, and we require you to see more than just the black and white, and trust more than just
someone's "gut" judgement. We require you to think independently, be self-motivated, and use technology and data
to inform decision-making and increase efficiency. You won't be smothered in corporate nonsense, or pointless meetings,
or valueless work. When you speak up, you won't be judged for being wrong or asking questions, or for disagreeing with
someone, or them with you, we don't hold grudges, retaliate, engage in passive-aggressive nonsense, play political 
games, or overly rely on a corporate hierarchy. If you're mad, frustrated, or feeling something strongly, you will
have the forums to do so without repercussion anonymously and publicly. You are encouraged to be your true self here,
nothing more, nothing less, and I think you'll be happier, smarter, more creative, and more fulfilled than otherwise.

### Managing People

It's truly sad how many large companies treat engineering staff like factory workers who take orders in->out widgets,
and how many engineering "managers" don't understand the nuances of team chemistry and personalities of individuals,
the interrelationships between computing systems and how they relate to a business or society. They often think in terms 
of how long something should "take" or what process to "follow", instead of what value are we "creating" or destroying, or
thoughtlessly apply "management" idiocy from some scientific study or book they have little comprehension on, or more likely
have never even read, and thus never even had the full context on, and then mindlessly quote soundbites from them and
then use this "gut" judgement style thinking to steer their "decision" making. I'm looking at you "Dunning-Kruger", 
"Peter Principle", "Culture Fit", and idiotic engineering archetype stereotypes like the "brilliant jerk". The world is a
complex place, a person is more complex than a label, and we reject that kind of thinking. These same folks then wonder
why everything breaks so often, why there's so much "technical debt", never "enough" engineers, why their best employees
quit on them, and why it "takes" so long to implement features, and why their customers are unhappy. I've met 100s of
engineering managers, and worked with over a dozen closely over my career, and I'm confident in saying that
not a single one of them understands the full exponential value of a master engineer, or the depth of this craft,
let alone the human experience.

The traditional use of managers will not exist here for engineers. Many of those "duties" like when someone isn't meeting
"expectations" will fall closer to the executive level such as an engineering director. We will instead use public,
peer reviewable scorecards where engineers earn points linked to achievements, and how they achieved them, and the quality
of the work, and we will use performance coaches to help our teams work in cohesion, help you resolve personal
and work conflicts, and help us grow leaders and stronger characters. None of these coaches will be used for any
secret messaging or gossiping, and unless otherwise stated by them all of your talks will be confidential
barring only exceptional circumstances, unless you're explicitly told otherwise.

### How We Measure Success

Without light, there is darkness, and where it is dark, nothing of value is grown. As such, we'll use peer reviewed, 
public scorecards that are published each quarter that we'll use to capture attributable value creation. They
will be additive in nature only, with feedback on areas of guidance/focus for growth from the technical leads you
work with. Your performance coach will provide you feedback on non-technical areas for growth on a regular basis.
Everyone will have a public scorecard, and this card will be broad enough so that it can capture many of the aspects 
and specific talents of each individual and most points will be linked directly to project tasks completed,
and how they map to elements of engineering excellence and at the team level in aggregate to directly
attributable business value creation. 

You will always know exactly how your performance compares to your peers, how your project relates to the business
value it creates, and where you stand. A refreshing alternative to the common practise of wasting time and energy on
gaming a highly political and usually grossly unfair blackbox; in other words we're trading a system that empowers
sociopaths for one that rewards exceptional human beings. We'd prefer you to be able to spend that mental
energy on creating value and learning instead.

All promotions are to be self-nominated, with one window per quarter, the only qualification are that some minimum 
threshold of points have been earned. All successful promotion packets will be published internally for others to
read from. Unsuccessful packets, will be aggregated and anonymized (unless the submitter is ok with a public release)
in the same way.

Each quarter, staff+ level engineers who have worked with you and guided you, among others, will form committees and 
adjust/normalize points for consistency, and will partner with our psychologists to do our best to reduce the impact
of bias (implicit, and explicitly) on measurements, and will offer public and private forums for any disagreements that
aren't resolved informally.

### How We Reward Success

The use of scorecards will be the primary basis of variable level compensation, meaning pay outside base RSUs, salary,
and so forth. There will be no cap on variable pay in some cases.

There's two main distinct classifications of engineering levels

1. IC (typically L3-L5)
2. Leadership (L6-L8)
   a. Staff (L6)
   b. Sr Staff(L7)
   c. Director (L8)

### Philosophy on Engineering Growth

There's an art to doing things well, those who can see the details and have the right passion and talent for
engineering can reach their full potential in the right environment, and in some cases then go on to become Rembrandts,
Mozarts, who then go on to make a lasting impact onto the world, and those who don't who are usually unhappy, unfilled,
and dread mondays a bit too much. Those who don't are typically unhappy, unfulfilled, rarely compensated well, and dread
mondays a bit too much.

IC level engineers will be brought on initially to support staff+ engineers who are implementing complex long-running
projects. Things will look more like an apprenticeship, similar to how apprentices would study under the tutelage
of a master artist during the Renaissance. They'll help mold you into a world-class level engineer. If later on find
that another staff engineer's project or their style of teaching works better for you, then you're free to make
transitions, though a two quarter residence should be the minimum barring exceptional cases.

### How We Reward Jr-Sr ICs Task Roles

IC level engineers will have some tasks classes to earn points from and some variable minimum, relative to project etc. 
These should offer enough bandwidth for these engineers to take on "above and beyond" tasks if desired inside the task
class level, or up to 1 task class levels higher by default, and up to the max (if approved). 

### How We Reward Success Staff+

Staff+ level engineers may have some IC type work assignments they must meet, and will also earn some points from 
this. However, they must also meet some variable minimum of staff+ level task classes and are measured on a staff+
level scorecard. At the staff L6 role, being a technical lead of any arbitrarily difficult project would be your 
entry level type of work. Creating, proposing, doing project management of, and execution of large technical projects
is expected. The largest variable bonuses will be tied to those who can come up with, delineate the business value of
accurately, and then execute projects successfully. Along those lines, for example; if you came up with an innovative
idea and lead that idea successfully, and it leads to the creation of a major business line, you can expect to have an
extraordinarily high bonus that isn't capped, and could even exceed what could be earned from a typical c-level executive,
and offered a higher leadership position if desired.

As you go staff->dir+, you'll need to have additionally competences around managing business operations and expenses,
handling org/x-functional interactions, and business strategy
